#  🔥 Sonnen nginx deployment task 🔥
This assignment aims to deploy a custom NGINX Web App to a local Kubernetes cluster using Helm by Terraform

### ✨ Prerequisites:
1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
2. Install [act](https://github.com/nektos/act#installation) >> to allow to run GitHub Actions locally which is perfect for the assignment requirment
```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
echo 'eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.bashrc
eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
brew install act
```
3. Install [k3d](https://k3d.io/#installation)
4. Install [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)

### ✨ Steps to test the application:
1️⃣ clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mohammed-Feshar/sonnen-nginx-deployment-task
```
2️⃣ goto script directory
```bash
cd script/
```
3️⃣ make file executable
```bash
chmod +x run.sh
```
4️⃣ set docker access token that was shared via email
```bash
export DOCKER_PASSWORD="docker_password"
```
5️⃣ run the script
```bash
./run.sh
```

### ✨ Why using K3D on local machines:
I picked k3d because it's a lightweight wrapper around k3s that allows spinning up a local Kubernetes cluster in seconds.and by default it creates a single node cluster where the control plane and worker are combined togther, and it's great for machines with limited resources like laptops, also it's ideal for local development or testing environments


### ✨ Improvments:
#### Environment Configuration:
To better manage multiple environments (dev, sit, uat, prod), we can create a config/ directory inside the terraform/ folder. Each environment will have its own terraform.tfvars file:
```bash
terraform/config/dev/terraform.tfvars
terraform/config/sit/terraform.tfvars
...
```
During deployment, the appropriate file can be used dynamically in GitHub Actions based on the target environment
for example
```bash
terraform apply -auto-approve -var-file=../config/${environment}/terraform.tfvars
```
#### Git Branching Strategy
Adopting the GitFlow branching model enhances CI/CD and environment isolation:

    dev branch → for deploying to development and SIT environments

    main branch → for deploying to the production environment

    

❌ Important:
#### If you faced this Error while running act "Error: cannot re-use a name that is still in use"
#### You need to unistall the helm release then run again
Example: 
```bash
helm list -n dev
```
```bash
helm uninstall nginx-local -n dev
```
